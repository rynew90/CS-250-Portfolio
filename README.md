    How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
            Interpreting user needs involves understanding the client and user and what they want the program to be able to do. Implementing those user needs will require some help and insight from the client and the potential users to ensure that the program isn't too complex or confusing. User stories are a great way to plan what needs to be developed first and how it should look. This will help with understanding what the program needs from the user side and how it should function to better serve the user.
    
    How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
            Using an agile approach when developing programs allows enough flexibility in the development process to allow for quick and easy implementation of changes that the client may have later on in the process. Utilizing daily standups, Scrum teams, and Sprints in my future development work will allow me to approach program development projects in the future with more certainty and confidence in my ability to create a program that will satisfy all user and client needs.
    
    What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
            A good team member strives for good communication across the team to ensure that everyone is on the same page and looks for ways to help other members of the team, after their own tasks have been completed. A good team member also is not afraid to voice where they may have short comings so they can get the help that they need in order to not slow down the entire team.
